# 🧠 AI-Powered Debugging Compiler for C Code

Welcome to the official repository of our **AI + Rule-Based Debugging Compiler**, developed as a major project by **Team GKS Coders** (B.Tech - CSE, Final Year). This tool is designed to assist programmers in identifying, understanding, and fixing errors in C programs using both traditional parsing techniques and modern AI-powered suggestions.

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🔍 **Syntax Analysis**
- 💡 **AI-Based Error Detection & Correction** using OpenAI's GPT API
- 🛠️ **Rule-Based Semantic Error Checking**
- 📌 **Instant Suggestions** with highlighted problem areas
- 🖥️ **(Upcoming)**: User-Friendly GUI Interface for live debugging

## 💡 How It Works

1. **Input C Code** ➝ via text or file
2. **Error Detection**:
   - Lexical Errors (invalid tokens)
   - Syntax Errors (grammar violations)
   - Semantic Errors (type mismatches, undeclared variables)
3. **AI Module**:
   - When an error is found, a GPT model analyzes the context and suggests possible corrections with explanations.
4. **Output**:
   - Highlighted errors + AI suggestions
   - Corrected version of the code (optional)
